# Risk Analysis in Banking
This project delves into the fundamentals of risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector. The primary objective is to gain insight into how data is leveraged to mitigate the risk of financial loss associated with lending to customers.
## Business Understanding:
Loan providing companies often face challenges in extending loans to individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Some consumers exploit this by defaulting on their loans. As an employee of a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers, your task is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in the data. This analysis aims to ensure that loan applicants capable of repayment are not unfairly rejected.

Risks Associated with Loan Approval:
When evaluating loan applications, the company faces two primary risks:

**Loss of Business:** If a creditworthy applicant is denied a loan, the company loses potential business.<br>
**Financial Loss:** If an applicant is likely to default but is approved for a loan, the company risks financial loss.

Data Description:
The dataset provided includes information about loan applications at the time of submission. It categorizes applicants into two scenarios:

Clients with Payment Difficulties: Individuals who have experienced late payments of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan.
All Other Cases: Applicants who have made payments on time.
Decision Categories:
When a client applies for a loan, four types of decisions can be made:

**Approved:** The company approves the loan application.<br>
**Cancelled:** The client cancels the application, either due to a change of mind or receiving unfavorable terms.<br>
**Refused:** The company rejects the loan application due to the client not meeting requirements.<br>
**Unused Offer:** The client cancels the loan at various stages of the process.
